There is also a relatively high degree of knowledge regarding land management and its impacts on soil erosion, and hence on potential drivers of sediment loads. For example, Uri and Lewis (1999) provide estimates of erosion from US cropland and Hu et al. (2008) likewise for erosion control measures in the Middle Yellow River Basin in China; Lal et al.
